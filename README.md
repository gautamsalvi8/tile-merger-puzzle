🔷 Tile Merger: A Level-Based 2048-Inspired Puzzle Game
Welcome to Tile Merger, a strategic and visually appealing puzzle game inspired by the classic 2048—reimagined with level progression, targeted merging, and controlled tile flow.

🎮 Game Concept
Unlike traditional 2048, Tile Merger introduces a level-based objective system:

🧩 Controlled Movement: Tiles move only to the adjacent direction chosen by the player—no auto-jumping or randomness.
🔼 Tile Spawning From Above: New tiles drop only from the top, maintaining control and pacing.
🎯 Target-Based Progression: Each level has a defined target tile (e.g., 100, 200, 300...) to reach by merging.
🔄 Progressive Scoring: Scores don’t reset—your new level starts with the tile value you reached in the last.

🧠 How It Works
You start with low-value tiles.

Merge similar ones strategically to exactly match the level’s target score.
Once you match the target, you progress to the next level and see the previous target tile on the board as proof of achievement.
The goal is to reach higher levels by playing logically and not overshooting the targets.
