üî∑ Tile Merger: A Level-Based 2048-Inspired Puzzle Game
Welcome to Tile Merger, a strategic and visually appealing puzzle game inspired by the classic 2048‚Äîreimagined with level progression, targeted merging, and controlled tile flow.

üéÆ Game Concept
Unlike traditional 2048, Tile Merger introduces a level-based objective system:

üß© Controlled Movement: Tiles move only to the adjacent direction chosen by the player‚Äîno auto-jumping or randomness.
üîº Tile Spawning From Above: New tiles drop only from the top, maintaining control and pacing.
üéØ Target-Based Progression: Each level has a defined target tile (e.g., 100, 200, 300...) to reach by merging.
üîÑ Progressive Scoring: Scores don‚Äôt reset‚Äîyour new level starts with the tile value you reached in the last.

üß† How It Works
You start with low-value tiles.

Merge similar ones strategically to exactly match the level‚Äôs target score.
Once you match the target, you progress to the next level and see the previous target tile on the board as proof of achievement.
The goal is to reach higher levels by playing logically and not overshooting the targets.
